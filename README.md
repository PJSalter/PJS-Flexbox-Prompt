## [:full_moon_with_face: :star2: :satellite: :milky_way: :new_moon_with_face: :alien: A project that shows my understanding on using Flexbox Layout, click this hyper link here to see my finished prompt project :alien: :new_moon_with_face: :milky_way: :satellite: :star2: :full_moon_with_face:](pjsalter.github.io/pjs-flexbox-prompt/)

### I was asked to create a project which uses my skill in flexbox layout, I've built a container that stored each element and I've used properties like justify-content, align-items and flex-wrap with a felx-direction to show all the fun elements within the styled page.

### I've added a hover styling which transforms by zooming into a larger scale version of the image once you hover other.

### Hope You Enjoy :raised_hands: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: :rocket:
